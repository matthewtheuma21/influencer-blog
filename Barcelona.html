            <p>I have went on a vacation to Barcelona with a football team I was in before, and we enjoyed every minute
                of it.
                The whole purpose of it was to celebrate our big victory in an italian tournament held by a private
                authority.
                Although I prefare to go abroad alone, this was something new to me, and it made me realise how
                beneficial it can be.
                From sharing the cost and spending on smaller prices to being more safe around. </p>

            <br>

            <p><b>Barcelona is a city on the coast of north-eastern of Spain. It is the largest city in Spain, having known
                for its art and architecture. The city's cosmopolitan and international vibe makes it a favorite city 
                for many people around the world.</b></p>

            <P> My stay (at Hotel Samba - three star hotel) was in Lloret De Mar (70km away from Barcelona) a
                Mediterranean coastal town in Catalonia, and it is known well for its night life, beaches, stores,
                clubs,
                gaming rooms, and its astonishing views (local activities stay open late at night). I really loved the
                nature there. </P>

            <br>

            <p> The Hotel Samba has a very pleasent and enjoyable stay, and it is only 2 minutes away from the beach.
                The
                hotel had a big lovely pool with very friendly stuff, they had access to laundry rooms and their
                breakfast,
                lunch and dinner was delicious with a variety to choose! My room had its lovely sea view that Lloret De Mar 
                offers. This hotel deserves more stars, I had no complaints on my stay. </p>

            <p> Local food in Spain was delicious! I have tried an appetizing Burrito with chicken, beans and salsa; and
                I
                also have tried the Bocadilo sandwich with pork, tomato, tuna and cheese. Now I would love to live in
                Spain, because
                knowing that Spanish people consider the Bocadilo sandwich as breakfast too, then it could be my new
                breakfast. I
                clearly love food so much. When it comes to something sweet, they have the fried churros, which I
                personally
                think it was my favourite! I have been trying to find a restaurant that does churros since then, and
                never
                had the same feeling as I enjoyed the churros from Spain.</p>

            <h3>The array of things to see and do in Spain is so wide.</h3>

            <br>

            If you like amusement parks, you can find PortAventura, (Salou) Isla
            Magica (Seville), Parque Warmer Madrid (Madrid), Parque de Atracciones Tibidabo (Barcelona), Siam Park
            (Costa Adeje),
            and more...

            <br>
            <br>

            If architecture fascinates you, you can find a variety of art styles and movements followed in the cities of
            Spain.
            La Sagrada Familia is a magnificent cathedral (still ongoing project construction), representing the Gothic
            Style on
            all its facades. Casa Batllo is a famous artistic building that represents the Art 'Nouveau' style, and it
            is very unique from other buildings. On the other hand, there is Valencia (I haven't been there yet, but
            definetly in
            my list), which is a city on the southeastern coast. Valencia also has spectacular architecture, such as the
            Ciudad
            de las Artes y las Ciencias (The City of Art and Sciences), featuring modernism and futuristic cultures.

            <h4>Budapest, Hungary</h4>
        </div>

            <p>One of my most favourite trips I been in, an unforgettable one. I spent only three days in Budapest, but
                I
                surely believe it was enough and worth visiting! I think its my most favourite city of Europe.

                <br>
                <br>

                <b>Budapest
                    is
                    the capital city of Hungary and it is well known for its spectacular architecture, its wide history,
                    steam
                    baths and their delicious food. The city is divided by the Danube River into two parts; BUDA
                    (settled
                    with architecture and nature) and PEST (home for restaurants, bars and cafes.). Ideally you first
                    start
                    by exploring the Buda side
                    as you get to enjoy the views that the city offers and the beautiful architecture on site. </b>
            </p>

            <p>My hotel stay was in the five-star Hilton hotel, that had a breath-taking view of the river and the rest
                of the landscape of Budapest. I was just so impressed, one of a kind! It is located within a UNESCO
                World
                Heritage Site,
                the Castle District in Buda. The hotel may not be for everyone, as it was a very expensive stay, but it
                was definetly amazing! My room was very clean, spacious (especially having a single room alone) and my
                bed was so comfortable! The hotel also had a gym and a fancy restaurant.

            <p>Certain names are difficult to pronounce for English Speakers... apparently 'Kürtőskalács' is whats
                called
                their delicious sweet chimney cake. The Kürtőskalács isa rolled strip of dough sprinkled with a lot of
                sugar, or any
                other kind of toppings (best dessert I have ever tried)! During my stay there I found out that Hungarian
                food itself
                is varied and often rich. Hungarians start their meals with soup as it is quite likely a tradition. They
                also love to
                present their food in a very appealing manner. So I just wanted to try every single Hungarian dish, they
                all just
                stole my gaze and made me so hungry.</p>

            <br>

            <p>Some dishes that I have tasted were, The Goulash Dish (a stew with meat and spices over noodles), a
                casserole
                dish with layered potatoes, sour cream, sausage, and eggs (called the Rakott Krumpli), and I also tried
                their
                delicious Kolbász (sausage). When it comes to desserts, everything looked so elegant and tasty.

            <P>In the last century alone, the city has been devastated and rebuilt three times - after the defeat in
                WW1, again after the Nazi and Soviet invasions of WW2, and in 1956 during the anti-Soviet revolution
                and ensuing siege. Today the city has real depth for us travellers to dive into, everything was
                remarkable. I have visited the astonishing Hungarian Parliament, the Fisherman's Bastion, the Buda
                castle (The Royal Palace), the beautiful Matthias Church and the historical landmark, the shoes on
                the Danube bank!</P>

            <br>

            <p><b>The Fisherman's Bastion</b> is a tower atop the Buda Castle Hill, which features a breath-taking view
                of
                the city, a cafe on the terrace and a church inside. When I saw this place from miles away, I thought
                it was some Disney Castle Attraction, but it just looked so beautiful and unreal getting closer. Also,
                the entrance was free! Isn't that awesome?</p>

            <br>

            <p><b>The Matthias Church</b> (aka the Coronation Church) is a beautiful Catholic Church in front of the
                Fisherman's Bastion. It is so beautiful, i was really impressed by its architectural design!
                Unfortunatly it was closed that day, so I couldn't see the inside. Today it is used for wedding
                events, concerts and for holy masses. The King Bela III of Hungary and Croatia was buried here.
            </p>

            <br>

            <p><b>'The Shoes on the Danube Promenade'</b> is a monument made up or iron across the Danube River, serving
                a memorial to the Jews who were murdered on that spot During World War II. I asked a Hungarian nearby,
                and
                he told me there are sixty pair of shoes in total. There was this Hungarian Government party called
                "Arrow
                Cross Party", which consisted of soldiers murdering people. In the 1944, Jews were shot and thrown in
                the
                Danube River, and this is what the monument represents as a memorial.</p>

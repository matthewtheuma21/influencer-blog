            <h4>Nuremberg, Germany</h4>
        </div>

        <div class="content-row">
            <p>I haven't been much to Germany unfortunatly, but it definetly is in my list to continue exploring the
                Deutsch
                culture and the vast of Berlin. I have been to Nuremberg for a private meeting, but someone with a
                passion
                for travelling like me, wouldn't not explore around what Nuremberg really offers! So I decided to stay
                their
                for one night alone and do my assignment there. I may say I wasn't happy with everything, I encountered
                a lot
                of rude people during my stay there, but it may sound rude to me just because Im not used to their way
                of
                speaking. Germans talk very harsh, resulting in their language to be stronger than others.

                <br>
                <br>

            <P><b>Nuremberg is the second-largest city of the German state of Bavaria after its capital Munich. As I
                    wandered
                    around the city, I noticed that there was a lot of old beautiful historical landmarks (that were
                    built
                    from a very long time ago, back to the 10th century, and are being well preserved).
                    Its location was an important commercial hub since the middle ages onwards. Back in World War II,
                    the city was
                    severly destroyed in just one hour, leaving many killed. But the city was then well reconstructed.
                    The city felt very
                    clean and friendly. There was a lot of restaurants, nightlife and more.</b></p>

            </div>

            <P>The hotel I stayed in was the Hotel Ramada Nürnberg Park Hotel which is just 10 minutes away from the Old
                Town of
                Nuremberg. My room was quite spacious for a single-room and it was a very cozy room, but I felt it was
                too expensive. The hotel also had a gym, an indoor pool and a courtyard in the middle. But as the time
                reached 10pm,
                noise started growing from the outside, I heard men shouting, loud cars driving by and even loud german
                music... it
                was crazy! I couldn't sleep that night. It seems that at night, the city gets crowded. On the other hand
                the breakfast was really good, it was that morning I learnt "gut" was not
                my stomach, but "GOOD!". I woke up with my stomach hurting that morning, because I didn't eat anything,
                and I just
                asked the waiter "What kind of bread do you have here? My gut is hurting...", and he just laughed at my
                face.

                <br>
                <br>

                Lesson learned!
            </P>

            <P>Unfortunatly I haven't tried any German Traditional Food, as after breakfast I rushed for check-out and
                to the airport. But it was a worth to see the city's landmarks, such as the Nuremberg Castle,
                St. Lorenz Medieval Church, Albrecht Dürer's House, St. Sebaldus Church, Nazi Party Rally Grounds and
                the Pegnitz River to walk by.</P>

            <br>

            <p><b>Nuremberg Castle</b> is the main symbol of this city, representing power and importance of the Roman
                Empire. It is said that this castle has been built since the 11th century. The castle is a group of
                medieval fortified buildings located in the center of the city.

                <br>
                <br>

            <p><b>St. Lorenz Medieval Church</b> is another landmark to visit, a church of two sharp towers. I have
                found out that this church was one of the first churches in Germany to be Lutheran. The west facade
                features a beautiful facade, which I think reflects on the wealth of the people who live here, and
                the medieval characteristics that was portrayed during this period.</p>

            <br>

            <p><b>Albrecht Dürer</b> was a German Renaissance artist from the 1500s, and he used to live in Nuremberg.
                His house was just five minutes from the castle, so I walked it whilst enjoying the views of the city.
                As
                I arrived, I see a five story typical German House, I was really fascinated! This house was really
                beautiful! After his death, it is now a museum dedicating his life and work. </p>

            <br>

            <p><b>The Nazi Party Rally Grounds</b> were stages to keep up the image of Adolf Hitler as an embodiment
                of the "Volksgemeinschaft" and the "Führer" myth during the second world war. Mass parades, speeches,
                folk festivals, fireworks, and military
                displays were held here as preparations for war. Today there is just the remains, serving great history.

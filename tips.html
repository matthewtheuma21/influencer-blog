        <h3>1. The Earlier You Book, The Cheaper The Flight</h4>
            <p>Timing plays an important part when booking your flight. Usually tickets don't get cheaper, but
                usually gets more expensive when you book between four months and three weeks before your
                departure date. So I always recommend that you plan your flight early as 
                possible. Compare prices with multiple travel companies so that you see which is cheaper.</p>

        <h3>1. The Earlier You Book, The Cheaper The Flight</h3>
        <p>Timing plays an important part when booking your flight. Usually tickets don't get cheaper, but
            usually gets more expensive when you book between four months and three weeks before your
            departure date. So I always recommend that you plan your flight early as
            possible. Compare prices with multiple travel companies so that you see which is cheaper.</p>

        <br>

        <h3>2. Check your stay!</h3>
        <p>Before you go to travel somewhere, you must check important fields to make sure that they
            settle with your standards. This can be the culture, kind of food, means of transport,
            the current weather conditions and climate, if people can speak + understand English (some
            countries have their majorities not able to speak english), the local stores around your stay
            and the taxes, the local attractions that there is, the petrol/diesel cost (if your travelling
            with a car) and even maybe some important laws that the country takes case of.
        </p>

        <br>

        <h3>3. Eating snacks makes you a prince.</h3>
        <p>I always prefare to prepare some snacks in my bag (at least five snacks). Yes I am a big
            food lover, but it is essential to bring some snacks in case any kind of emergency happens.
            This would help you save money and always have something in bag rather than stopping somewhere.
            Although, do not overload! Keep things light. It is also important that you bring a reusable 
            bottle for water to drink. Stay healthy around hydrated.

        </p>

        <br>

        <h3>4. Plan your days, make a schedule!</h3>
        <p>Before you plan your flight, you should plan what you will be doing, considering the breakfast
            time, check-in + check-out, when you will leave the hotel and come back, the distance between
            one place and another, etc... I usually create an Excel Sheet and balance your days. You must
            also consider the travelling, the local attractions (if they have certain time each) or even
            the parking fees. Consider everything that you will plan and what it can lead to.
        </p>

        <br>

        <h3>5. Prioritize the budget</h3>
        <p>Find the cheapest flights and hotels, but that meet your needs. Avoid traveling to a destination 
            during its high season, as it is not ideal (prices get higher). I have been noticing that the ideal
            part of the week to buy a ticket is midweek (tuesdays and wednesdays), as they seem to be the 
            cheapest. Checking up people's reviews and information that you might be looking for can help. If 
            you want to save up money, dont look for the best hotel room; what's important is that your needs
            come to satisfaction (such as: sleeping, location, food, accessibility and services). 
        </p>

        <br>

        <h3>6. Stay comfortable and be ready!</h3>
        <p>Always wear clothes that make you feel comfortable, stretchy, cozy and easy to dry. Avoid
            clothes with holes or baggy, or ones that make you feel itchy. Going abroad for a holiday
            involves a lot of walking and moving around.
